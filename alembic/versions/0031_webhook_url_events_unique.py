"""Partial unique index on (url, events) for live webhooks (issue #562).

Without a DB constraint, two concurrent ``POST /webhooks`` calls with the same
url+events tuple could both succeed, resulting in duplicate fan-out: every
matching event would fire twice for the same consumer.

The index is *partial* (``WHERE deleted_at IS NULL``) so that:
- Soft-deleted tombstones (#518) never block re-registration of the same url.
- The per-row check is enforced atomically by PostgreSQL instead of a
  serialisable application-level query.

``events`` is a TEXT column (JSON-encoded array). PostgreSQL's btree operator
accepts TEXT equality, so a unique index on ``(url, events)`` compares the
serialised representations directly. ``create_webhook`` uses
``canonical_json([e.value for e in payload.events])`` for the column, so the
serialisation is deterministic (keys sorted, no extra whitespace) and the
constraint fires reliably for truly identical subscriptions.

Because nothing prevented duplicates before this revision, the upgrade first
soft-deletes every live duplicate but the oldest. This mirrors the #518
tombstone convention — the row and its delivery history survive while it stops
being dispatched — and is required for the index to build on an existing
database.
